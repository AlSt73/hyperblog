            <p>Zelensky standing up to Putin like he stood up to 
                Trump when he tried to blackmail him into announcing 
                a fake investigation into Biden bcs he couldn't win 
                w/o cheating. Trump threatened to withhold military 
                aid. Got impeached. Ukrainians now defend themselves 
                with  that U.S. aid.</p>
